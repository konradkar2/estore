# e-store
Web API for an e-commerce video game shop
## About
The project is migration of https://github.com/konradkar2/store to .NET

## Changes
The most import change is that table PK from now on will be generated on API app as GUIDs, not in the database as integers.

Appsettings are kept in the repo as it is only educational project.
