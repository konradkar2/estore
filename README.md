# e-store
Web API written in C# .NET for an e-commerce video game shop
## About
The project is migration of https://github.com/konradkar2/store to .NET

The most import change is that table PKs from now on will be generated on APP as GUIDs, not in the database as integers.

Appsettings are kept in the repo as it is only educational project.
